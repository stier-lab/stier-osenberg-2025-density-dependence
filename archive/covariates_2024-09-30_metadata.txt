## Abstract
This dataset includes study-level metadata and covariates for each substudy incorporated in a meta-analysis of density-dependent mortality in nearshore marine fishes. It contains ecological traits, experimental design details, and derived variables used as moderators in meta-regression models. The data were compiled from primary literature and used to explain variation in estimated parameters of mortality models.
