Spawning was seasonal, occurring primarily between January and August. Recruitment was seasonal, and was significantly correlated with spawning with time lags of 1 and 2 mo. This is consistent with the 45 d (range 33 to 64 d) larval life of T. bifasciatum, and suggests that seasonal variation in spawning is the principal factor driving seasonal variation in recruitment. Spawning frequency was higher around new and full moons (spring tides) than around first and last quarters (neap tides), but recruitment did not differ significantly with lunar phase. Daily spawning was more frequent during ebb tides than flood tides, with peak spawning occurring near the beginning of ebb tide. Surface currents on the study reefs were offshore on 96 % of the 94 occasions monitored, regardless of tidal phase. Surface currents at ebb tide were faster than at flood tide, and ebb tide currents were faster during spring tides than neap tides. The data suggest that both daily and lunar spawning cycles are influenced by daily and lunar variation in the speed of offshore currents. Population densities on all reefs had returned to pre-recruitment levels within 3 mo of the end of seasonal recruitment. Monthly mortality (% dying per month) on each study reef during the post-recruitment period was correlated with population density on that reef at the start of the month. This may suggest that post-recruitment mortality is density-dependent, but it could result from the covariance of density with age.

Populations of cunner on these reefs were subjected to experimental manipulations of adult and recruit population density. Settlement of cunner was unaffected by the density of prior resident adults. Elevation of adult densities to approximately twice natural levels resulted in complete mortality of newly settled fish, while removal of adults resulted in enhanced growth and recruitment success over natural populations. This clearly demonstrates that natural populations of cunner in St. Margaret's Bay are sufficiently high to result in density-dependent growth and post-settlement mortality. Growth and mortality of newly settled fish were also suppressed by high recruit densities and enhanced by low densities of conspecific recruits. On all study reefs, newly settled cunner formed social dominance hierarchies, and both growth rate and post-settlement survival were positively correlated with fish size.

Field observations at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) showed that for a coral reef damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis, juvenile mortality (over 1 year) varied between 20 and almost 100% among sites. Correlative data showed that juvenile mortality increased as a function of initial densities (recruitment), predator densities and the availability of preferred coral substrata. A multiple regression showed that these three variables together did not explain significantly more variation in mortality than the single factor showing the strongest relationship. This appeared to be because recruitment, predator densities and preferred coral substrata were all highly correlated, suggesting that one, two or all of these factors may be influencing juvenile mortality rates. One hypothesis was that density-dependent mortality in juveniles was the result of an interaction between predators (which appear to aggregate at high-recruitment sites) and the availability of preferred substrata (predator refuges). We tested this hypothesis by using both laboratory and field experiments to see whether fish predation could significantly alter survivorship of this damselfish, and whether this impact was dependent upon the coral substratum. The laboratory experiment was designed to test the effects of three common predators (Pseudochromis fuscus, Cephalopholis boenak and Thalassoma lunare) and three different coral substrata that varied in their complexity (Pocillopora damicornis, Acropora nasuta and A-nobilis) on the survival of juvenile Pomacentrus moluccensis. There was a significant interaction between predator species and microhabitat in determining survival, Pseudochromis fuscus and C-boenak were both significantly better at capturing juvenile damselfish than T-lunare. Juvenile survivorship was significantly better when they were given the more complex corals, Pocillopora damicornis and A-nasuta, compared with those given the open-structured species A-nobilis. This pattern reflects habitat selection in the field. Predators differed in their strike rates and the proportion of strikes that were successful, but all exhibited greater success at prey capture where A-nobilis was provided as shelter. The interaction between the effect of predator species and microhabitat structure on damselfish survival was tested in the field for a cohort of juvenile Pomacentrus moluccensis. We examined juvenile survival in the presence and absence of two predators that co-occur on natural patch reefs (C-boenak and Pseudochromis fuscus). The experimental patch reefs we used for this purpose were constructed from both high complexity (Pocillopora damicornis) and low complexity (A-nobilis) coral substrate. Both juveniles and predators were translocated to reefs at natural densities. The effects of predation were clearly dependent upon the microhabitat. Reefs of the high-complexity coral with predators supported the same high numbers of Pomacentrus moluccensis as the reefs with no resident predators. However, damselfish abundance was significantly lower on low-complexity reefs with resident predators, relative to the other treatments. Background rates of loss were high, even on preferred coral in the absence of the manipulated predator, suggesting that transient predators may be even more important than the residents. We suggest that adult abundances in this species were strongly influenced by the densities of different predators and the availability of preferred refuges.","303",308,"MAR",1998,114,"1",50,59,"10.1007/s004420050419",17,"Beukers and Jones 1997",-14.6683188,145.4609161,"Oecologia","unpaired",55,"DD","yes","0",0,-0.0125,0.00362,0,1.31e-05,"Obs",NA,"Pomacentridae","Pomacentrus_moluccensis","planktivore",2.47,"reef","Australia","Pacific","present",10,17.45,"mmSL",17.45,365

Variable recruitment was simulated by stocking a natural range of densities of young fishes on replicate patch reefs. Density and mortality of the stocked cohorts were followed over time, until the fishes reached maturity.

This major event coincided with stormy conditions associated with the new moon period. The abundance of new settlers was surveyed for 45 days following settlement on both the reef flat and the back reef area of the coral reefs of St Gilles, La Saline and St Leu. Mean densities of settlers were higher on reef flats (maximum 474 ind/20 m(2) at La Saline) than on back reef areas (maximum 156 ind/20 m(2) at La Saline). Seven weeks later, densities of settled E. merra had drastically decreased, and did not differ with site and zone (18.5 ind/20 m(2)). Percentages of post-settlement mortality at that period ranged from 85 to 88% in back reef areas and from 93 to 95% on reef flats. A strong correlation between density of recruits and per capita mortality suggests density-dependent early postsettlement mortality for E. merra. The limitation of food resources and shelters, perhaps combined with an increase of diseases due to high population densities of settlers, was probably the main cause of mortality just after the mass settlement. Predation by reef fish, including cannibalism between settlers, is probably responsible for most subsequent mortality.","30",31,"FEB",1998,78,"1",307,319,"10.1017/S0025315400040108",22,"Letourneur et al 1998",-21.1166667,55.53333333,"/.

The relationship between total recruitment per season at a site and adult abundance at the end of the season was similarly asymptotic, indicating the persistence of a density-dependent effect at the scale of the island. Mortality rates around the island were extremely variable and density independent at densities below similar to 1 recruit/m(2). Above that level, mortality rates were higher and tended to increase with further increases in recruitment density. Around St. Croix, three out of eight sites consistently received recruitment above this threshold, while five sites never experienced recruitment above that level during the study. Because spatial patterns of recruitment around St. Croix were consistent over time, some local populations may be controlled mainly by recruitment and density-independent mortality at all times, while others may be chronically affected by post-settlement density dependence. This study gives support to the idea that recruitment limitation and density dependence are not mutually exclusive. Rather, local populations must be characterized by the degree of recruitment, the resultant population density, and the subsequent degree of density-dependent regulation.","66",66,"MAY",1999,69,"2",177,194,"10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0177:EPSMIA]2.0.CO;2",25,"Caselle 1999",17.75,-64.58333333,"Ecological Mono","unpaired",77,"DD","yes","0",0,-0.0348,0.00533,0,2.84e-05,"Obs",4,"Labridae","Thalassoma_bifasciatum","planktivore (adults)",3.49,"reef","LesserAntilles","Caribbean","present",4.5,12,"mmSL",12,30

Patterns of mortality over a 2-wk period were estimated from daily counts of new settlers and of the next older age class (<1 mo old) following a natural settlement pulse to standard amounts of suitable microhabitat. Two spatial scales were explored: among 11 lagoon sites dispersed evenly around the 60-km perimeter of the island and among microhabitats within a site. For each species at both spatial scales, per capita mortality rates of new settler cohorts increased monotonically with density, whereas those of the next older cohort were density independent. Intra- and especially intercohort processes induced density-dependent mortality in new settler cohorts. Despite experimental densities that were only 15-25% of ambient, similar to 50% of the spatial variance in settler abundance was reduced by density-dependent mortality in 2 wk. The relative contributions of primary recruitment limitation and subsequent density-dependent loss in setting the average abundance of 2-wk-old recruits were estimated to be similar to 70% and similar to 12%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that density-dependent mortality may only occur for a brief period immediately after settlement of at least some reef fishes and that its influence can be relatively large at comparatively low densities. These results have major implications for current assessments of the relative importance of the processes that drive abundance and dynamics of species with demographically open populations.","106",106,"JAN",1999,80,"1",35,50,"10.2307/176978",26,"Schmitt and Holbrook 1999 - Ecology",-17.5,-149.8333333,"Ecology","unpaired",80,"DD","yes","0",0,-1e-04,2.29e-06,0,5.25e-12,"Exp",3,"Pomacentridae","Dascyllus_trimaculatus","planktivore",2.8,"reef","Moorea","Pacific","present",1,11,"mmSL",11,14

Two complementary approaches - based on limitation and elasticity - revealed the nature of interactions and nonlinearities among these processes. Data for an Indo-Pacific reef fish were used to document the settler-survivor relationship and to quantify natural variation in settlement. Limitation by density-dependence was two-fold and 20-fold greater than by supply or density-independent mortality, respectively. Elasticity analyses showed that adult abundance was 40% more sensitive to small proportionate changes in supply than in density-dependence.

Both experiments thus indicated that the density-dependent component of loss in C. glaucofraenum was caused, at least in part, by an interaction other than predation. The presence, intensity, and biological cause of density-dependent survival were thus strikingly different for each of these three fishes, despite the fact that they are taxonomically closely related and ecologically similar. These findings suggest a need for further studies aimed at predicting under what circumstances different mechanisms of population regulation will operate.","59",59,"SEP",2000,81,"9",2416,2427,NA,30,"Forrester and Steele 2000",33.45,-118.4833333,"Ecology","paired",97,"DD","yes","0",0,-0.0134,0.00162,0,2.62e-06,"Exp",NA,"Gobiidae","Coryphopterus_glaucofraenum","carnivore",2.67,"reef","Bahamas","Caribbean","absent",180,40,"mmSL",40,30

It is considered particularly important for many marine reef organisms with demographically open populations that lack potential regulatory mechanisms tied to local reproduction. While density-dependent mortality has been documented frequently for reef fishes, few studies have explored how the strength of density-dependence varies with density, or how density-dependence may be modified by numerical effects (i.e., number-dependent mortality). Both issues can have profound effects on spatial patterns of abundance and the regulation of local populations. I address these issues through empirical studies in Moorea, French Polynesia, of the six bar wrasse (Thalassoma hardwicke), a reef fish that settles to isolated patch reefs. Per capita mortality rates of newly settled wrasse increased as a function of density and were well approximated by the Beverton-Holt function for both naturally formed and experimentally generated juvenile cohorts. Average instantaneous mortality rates were a decelerating function of initial densities, indicating the per capita strength of density-dependence decreased with density. Results of a factorial manipulation of density and group size indicate that per capita mortality rates were simultaneously density- and number-dependent; fish at higher densities and/or in groups had higher probabilities of disappearing from patch reefs compared with fish that were solitary and/or at lower densities, Mortality rates were similar to 30% higher for fish at densities of 0.5 fish/m(2) than at 0.25 fish/m(2). Similarly, mortality rates increased by similar to 45% when group size was increased from 1 to 2 individuals per patch, even when density was kept constant. These observations suggest that the number of interacting individuals, independent of patch size (i.e., density independent effects) can contribute to regulation of local populations. Overall, this work highlights a greater need to consider numerical effects in addition to density effects when exploring sources of population regulation.","44",44,"JAN",2001,126,"1",58,65,"10.1007/s004420000486",31,"Shima 2001",-17.5,-149.8333333,"Oecologia","unpaired",99,"DD","yes","-0.05344035",0.0448,-0.121480648,0.0678,0.00200704,0.00459684,"Exp",NA,"Labridae","Thalassoma_hardwicke","carnivore",NA,"reef","Moorea","Pacific","present",3,10,"mmSL",10,14

Predation can strongly regulate populations by populational and behavioral responses of predators to their prey. Here I evaluate the existence and strength of density-dependent mortality in local populations of a reef fsh, the kelp perch (Brachyistius frenatus), caused by its predator, the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus). Specifically, I examine both the functional response and a potential aggregative response by kelp bass as mechanisms underlying predator-induced density-dependent mortality. I calculated the per capita mortality of kelp perch as a result of the functional response of its predator by subjecting a range of densities of kelp perch to a low, constant number of kelp bass and different amounts of giant kelp (Macrocystis,pyrifera) as habitat structure and a potential prey refuge. The potential for an aggregative response by kelp bass was determined by exposing densities of kelp perch to natural levels of kelp bass in the field. Per capita mortality of kelp perch in the laboratory was inversely density dependent to density independent with increasing habitat structure. By contrast, per capita mortality in the field was strongly density dependent, with evidence for an aggregative response by kelp bass. Furthermore, emigration and other nonpredatory losses of kelp perch from field plots were negligible, indicating that the product of the functional and aggregative responses by kelp bass induced density-dependent mortality in kelp perch. My results indicated that increasing habitat structural complexity at low densities of kelp perch, coupled with a strong aggregative response by kelp bass, was responsible for the observed pattern of density-dependent mortality. In addition, the distribution and relative abundances of kelp perch and kelp bass at larger spatial scales (entire reefs) were consistent with predation as an important process structuring local populations of kelp perch. The contrasting patterns of short-term per capita mortality found here underscore the need to evaluate both the functional and aggregative responses of predators to their prey. Ultimately, the pattern of mortality expressed will be determined by the relative strengths of these behavioral responses and the degree to which habitat structure provides an effective prey refuge.","186",192,"JAN",2001,82,"1",245,257,NA,32,"Anderson, 2001",33.45,-118.4833333,"Ecology","unpaired",101,"DD","yes","0",0,-0.0306,0.0063,0,3.97e-05,"Exp",5,"Embiotocidae","Brachyistius_frenatus","carnivore",3.5,"reef","California","Pacific","present",183,55.5,"mmSL",55.5,14

However, such studies are usually small scale and typically provide evidence of spatial (within-generation) density dependence. It is often unclear whether small-scale, experimental tests of spatial density dependence will accurately describe temporal (between-generation) density dependence required for population regulation. Understanding the mechanisms generating density dependence may provide a link between spatial experiments and temporal regulation of populations. In this study, I manipulated the density of recently settled kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) in both the presence and absence of predators to test for density-dependent mortality and whether predation was the mechanism responsible. I also examined mortality of rockfish cohorts within kelp beds throughout central California to evaluate temporal (between-generation) density dependence in mortality. Experiments suggested that short-term behavioral responses of predators and/or a shortage of prey refuges caused spatial density dependence.

We addressed this gap by monitoring larval supply, adult survivorship, and giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera, a primary habitat-forming species) abundance for 13 populations of kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) spread over similar to 200 km in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. At the small, within-site scale, both recruitment and adult survivorship of kelp bass were density-dependent and positively related to kelp abundance. At the larger, among-site scale, the spatial pattern of adult kelp bass abundance was predicted well by the pattern of kelp bass larval supply, but there was a consistent negative spatial relationship between kelp abundance and kelp bass larval supply despite the positive effects of kelp on kelp bass at the smaller spatial scale. This large-scale negative relationship was likely a product of a channel-wide spatial mismatch between oceanographic conditions that favor kelp survival and those that concentrate and distribute fish larvae. These results generally support the recruit adult hypothesis: kelp bass populations are limited by recruitment at low recruit densities but by density-dependent competition for food resources and/or predator refuges at high recruit densities. At the same time, spatial variation in kelp abundance produced substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in kelp bass demographics, which argues for a multispecies, metacommunity approach to predicting kelp bass dynamics.","39",39,"MAY",2008,89,"5",1323,1333,"10.1890/07-0840.1",57,"White and Caselle 2008 Ecology",33.9657951,-120.0918971,"Ecology","unpaired",209,"DD & IDD","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Obs",NA,"Serranidae","Paralabrax_clathratus","planktivore",NA,"kelp","California","Pacific","present",365,10,"mmSL",10,362.1875

A decline in habitat may lead to crowding of live coral specialists into remnant habitat patches, intensifying intraspecific competition. Increased local densities of conspecifics are known to negatively affect key demographic processes, but the magnitude of density effects and the role of crowding in response to habitat loss are poorly understood. In this study we examined habitat use and relationships between habitat availability and population density in a coral-dwelling damselfish - Chrysiptera parasema. First, we conducted habitat use and availability surveys to establish the level of habitat selectivity. We then investigated the evidence for crowding due to habitat loss by comparing densities within juvenile aggregations on natural reefs with high and low cover of the preferred habitat. Finally, we used a manipulative patch-reef experiment to measure the potential effects of crowding on mortality of juvenile C. parasema. Surveys revealed that 97% of juvenile C. parasema were associated with Acropora corals. Furthermore, C. parasema densities were closely related to the cover of bottlebrush Acropora, the preferred growth form. Contrary to predictions, there was no evidence of crowding on natural reefs with low coral cover, but rather, reefs with abundant Acropora cover supported larger aggregations with double the density of juveniles. We hypothesized that low densities of C. parasema on natural reefs with low coral cover could be explained by intense intraspecific competition. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile mortality was density-dependent, with mortality 20% higher on high-density experimental patch-reefs compared to low-density reefs. Behavioural observations on the patch-reefs revealed that the frequency of agonistic interactions and distance to shelter were both unrelated to conspecific densities, highlighting the need for further research into mechanisms underpinning density dependent mortality. These results suggest that intraspecific competition may play an important role in reducing reef fish abundance as a consequence of habitat loss. Given that coral reef systems are currently under threat, with a global decline in coral cover, this study adds to the growing body of knowledge of how disturbances to habitat may affect reef fish communities.

Species that live in groups, such as shoaling fish, can experience both direct density-dependent mortality through resource limitation and inverse number-dependent mortality via increased feeding rates and predator evasion in larger groups. To investigate the role of these processes in a temperate reef fish population, we manipulated the density and group size of the shoaling species Trachinops caudimaculatus on artificial patch reefs at two locations with different predator fields in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. We compared mortality over four weeks to estimates of predator abundance and per capita availability of refuge and food to identify mechanisms for density or number dependence. Mortality was strongly directly density dependent throughout the experiment, regardless of the dominant predator group; however, the limiting resource driving this effect changed over time. In the first two weeks when densities were highest, density-dependent mortality was best explained by refuge competition and the abundance of benthic predators. During the second two weeks, food competition best explained the pattern of mortality. We detected no effect of group size at either location, even where pelagic-predator abundance was high. Overall, direct density effects were much stronger than those of group size, suggesting little survival advantage to shoaling on isolated patch reefs where resource competition is high. This study is the first to observe a temporal shift in density-dependent mechanisms in reef fish, and the first to observe food limitation on short temporal scales. Food competition may therefore be an important regulator of postsettlement reef fish cohorts after the initial intense effects of refuge limitation and predation.","24",24,"MAY",2013,94,"5",1069,1077,"10.1890/12-1891.1",63,"Ford and Swearer 2013",-38.10717392,144.8415985,"Ecology","unpaired",226,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Exp",NA,"Plesiopidae","Trachinops_caudimaculatus","planktivore",NA,"reef","Australia","Pacific","present",60,35,"mmSL",35,14

All else being equal, strong density-dependent mortality should select against the formation of high-density aggregations, yet the juveniles of many reef fishes aggregate. In light of this apparent contradiction, we hypothesized that the form and intensity of density dependence vary with the spatial scale of measurement. Individual groups might enjoy safety in numbers, but predators could still produce density-dependent mortality at larger spatial scales. We investigated this possibility using recently settled juvenile bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a small, aggregating reef fish. An initial caging experiment demonstrated that juvenile bluehead wrasse settlers suffer high predation, and spatial settlement patterns indicated that bluehead wrasse juveniles preferentially settle in groups, although they are also found singly. We then monitored the mortality of recently settled juveniles at two spatial scales: microsites, occupied by individual fish or groups of fish and separated by centimeters, and sites, consisting of similar to 2400-m(2) areas of reef and separated by kilometers. At the microsite scale, we measured group size and effective population density independently and found that per capita mortality decreased with group size but was not related to density. At the larger spatial scale, however, per capita mortality increased with settler density. This shift in the form of density dependence with spatial scale could reconcile the existence of small-scale aggregative behavior typical of many reef fishes with the population-scale density dependence that is essential to population stability and persistence.","38",39,"DEC",2007,88,"12",3044,3054,"10.1890/06-1949.1",68,"White and Warner 2007",17.7289564,-64.759016,"Ecology","unpaired",247,"DD","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Obs",NA,"Labridae","Thalassoma_bifasciatum","carnivore",NA,"reef","LesserAntilles","Caribbean","present",1,15,"mmTL",12,29.54545455

D. trimaculatus young settle from the plankton to sea anemones, where they remain until becoming free-ranging adults. Daily settlement onto anemones without fish was estimated at several sites in a lagoon for one 14-day period and compared with patterns in the density of juveniles that had accrued after 10 successive settlement periods. Spatial variation attributable to larval supply occurred mostly among individual anemones, between the halves of each study site, and among different locations in the lagoon. In contrast, there was relatively little variation at any spatial scale in the density of young after 10 settlement pulses. Several mechanisms were examined that could account for the observed reduction in spatial variance through time, and three involving interactions with young already present were implicated. First, settlement was not independent of residents (the density of young already on an anemone); compared with the absence of fish, settlement was facilitated at low and inhibited at high densities of residents. Second, older juveniles moved among local anemones, and the immigration and emigration rates per capita varied with density on an anemone. Finally, per capita mortality during the first few days after settlement was density-dependent. These findings emphasize the critical need to distinguish among effects that arise from the delivery of larvae, the availability of appropriate habitat, and interactions that affect fish at settlement and immediately thereafter.","75",75,"",1996,47,"2",449,463,"10.1071/MF9960449",70,"schmittholbrook-mfw-1996",-17.5,-149.8333333,"MarineFreshwaterResearch","unpaired",250,"DD","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Obs",3,"Pomacentridae","Dascyllus_trimaculatus","planktivore",NA,"reef","Moorea","Pacific","present",1,10,"mmSL",10,1

The relative abundance of cunner recruits was tracked over 1 reproductive season via visual counts on line transects across similar habitats at 4 sites across 3 boulder reefs in the vicinity of the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station (PNPS) in Plymouth, Massachusetts, USA. Habitat characteristics including macroalgae structure, canopy height, rugosity (a measure of structure complexity), temperature, and visibility were measured at each site to assess the influence of these factors on recruit abundance. We assumed that immigration and emigration were not responsible for recruit abundance patterns through time due to the sedentary life history of cunner recruits, We observed differences in recruit abundance over the settlement period among reefs which were likely the result of differences in settlement. However recruitment at the end of the post-settlement period was similar across reefs. Recruit mortality rates among reefs differed in the post-settlement period, with the reef that had the highest density also having the highest mortality rate. Post-settlement mortality rates provided evidence for density-dependent mortality, since habitat and abiotic factors failed to explain the difference in mortality among reefs. Consequently, because of the existence of density-dependent processes in the post-settlement stages, entrainment mortality of the pre-settlement egg and larval stages by the PNPS will have a diminished effect on the local cunner population, An additional assessment of within-reef variability in recruitment also suggests recruitment success is sensitive to small changes in habitat structure which can occur over the recruitment season.","5",5,"",2002,226,"",165,178,"10.3354/meps226165",72,"Nitschke2002meps",-41.967,-70.65,"MEPS","unpaired",253,"DD","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Obs",NA,"Labridae","Tautogolabrus_adspersus","carnivore",3.7,"reef","NewEngland","Atlantic","present",30,45,"mmSL",45,63

All age classes of this species co-occur on live coral substrate. Thus, all age classes experience and interact with all other age classes. In addition, previous work in this system has shown that post-settlement processes varied over space and drove spatial variation in habitat quality (i.e. post-settlement survival of fishes varied among coral heads at a common density of fishes).

We used temporal manipulations of density to explore potentially stabilizing density dependence in early survivorship among six local populations of a tropical damselfish (Dascyllus fiavicaudus). Specifically, we tested the premise that spatial heterogeneity in the strength of temporal density dependence would reflect variation in density of predators, the agent of mortality. Our field manipulations revealed that mortality among successive cohorts of young fishes was density dependent at each reef, but that its strength varied by similar to 1.5 orders of magnitude. This spatial heterogeneity was well predicted by variation among the six reefs in the density of predatory fishes that consume juvenile damselfishes. Because density dependence arose from competition for enemy-free space within a shelter coral, the mortality consequence of the competition depended on the neighborhood density of predators. Thus, the scale of heterogeneity in the density dependence largely reflected attributes of the environment that shaped the local abundance of predators. These results have important implications for how ecologists explore regulatory processes in nature.

Here, we show how confounding effects of site quality can mask strong effects of density dependence. In particular, we explore spatiotemporal variation and covariation among (1) densities of newly settled coral reef fish (Thalassoma hardwicke). (2) environmental characteristics, and (3) the strength of density-dependent mortality. Environmental features of patch reefs were spatially and temporally variable and influenced density-dependent survival. Higher-quality sites (i.e., reefs possessing features that yield greater numbers of recruits at any given settlement level) received greater settlement, and this relationship masked the operation of density dependence when variation in quality among sites (or times) was not distinguished (a common approach in many observational studies of density dependence). Our work illustrates how spatiotemporal covariation in settlement density, and site quality can obscure patterns of density dependence at larger scales, contributing to a phenomenon we call cryptic density dependence. Acknowledging patterns and consequences of covariance may alter the way we study population dynamics. especially of marine organisms, where the link between processes that affect settlement and post-settlement survival remains relatively poorly understood.","99",101,"JAN",2003,84,"1",46,52,"10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0046:CDDEOC]2.0.CO;2",43,"Shima and Osenberg 2003",-17.5,-149.8333333,"Ecology","unpaired",136,NA,"yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Obs",NA,"Labridae","Thalassoma_hardwicke","carnivore",NA,"reef","Moorea","Pacific","present",1,10,"mmSL",10,90
