## Description
This file contains life-history trait data for reef fish species associated with individual substudies included in a meta-analysis of density-dependent mortality. Each row links a fish species to a unique substudy and provides body size metrics useful for trait-based synthesis and meta-regression.

## File Format
- File: unique_species_studies.xlsx
- Format: Excel (.xlsx), UTF-8 encoding
- Sheet name: unique_species_studies

## Column Descriptions
- g_sp: Genus_species name of reef fish [text]
- study_num: Integer ID of source study [unitless]
- substudy_num: Integer ID for each unique treatment or time series [unitless]
- max_len (cm): Maximum reported length for species [centimeters]
- Max_wt (ga): Maximum reported body weight for species [grams]

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- Temporal range: Substudies span 1990–2021
- Spatial extent: Global coral reef systems; see associated manuscript and `combined_results_2024-09-17.csv`

## Usage
- Used to examine trait-based predictors of density dependence (β) in fish mortality
- Joined by `substudy_num` to synthesis files like `combined_results_2024-09-17.csv` and `covariates-2024-09-30.csv`
- Used in scripts such as `5_model_selection_comparison.R` for regression analysis and model selection
