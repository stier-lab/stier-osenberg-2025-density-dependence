Populations of cunner on these reefs were subjected to experimental manipulations of adult and recruit population density. Settlement of cunner was unaffected by the density of prior resident adults. Elevation of adult densities to approximately twice natural levels resulted in complete mortality of newly settled fish, while removal of adults resulted in enhanced growth and recruitment success over natural populations. This clearly demonstrates that natural populations of cunner in St. Margaret's Bay are sufficiently high to result in density-dependent growth and post-settlement mortality. Growth and mortality of newly settled fish were also suppressed by high recruit densities and enhanced by low densities of conspecific recruits.

D. trimaculatus young settle from the plankton to sea anemones, where they remain until becoming free-ranging adults. Daily settlement onto anemones without fish was estimated at several sites in a lagoon for one 14-day period and compared with patterns in the density of juveniles that had accrued after 10 successive settlement periods. Spatial variation attributable to larval supply occurred mostly among individual anemones, between the halves of each study site, and among different locations in the lagoon. In contrast, there was relatively little variation at any spatial scale in the density of young after 10 settlement pulses. Several mechanisms were examined that could account for the observed reduction in spatial variance through time, and three involving interactions with young already present were implicated. First, settlement was not independent of residents (the density of young already on an anemone); compared with the absence of fish, settlement was facilitated at low and inhibited at high densities of residents. Second, older juveniles moved among local anemones, and the immigration and emigration rates per capita varied with density on an anemone. Finally, per capita mortality during the first few days after settlement was density-dependent.

This major event coincided with stormy conditions associated with the new moon period. The abundance of new settlers was surveyed for 45 days following settlement on both the reef flat and the back reef area of the coral reefs of St Gilles, La Saline and St Leu. Mean densities of settlers were higher on reef flats (maximum 474 ind/20 m(2) at La Saline) than on back reef areas (maximum 156 ind/20 m(2) at La Saline). Seven weeks later, densities of settled E. merra had drastically decreased, and did not differ with site and zone (18.5 ind/20 m(2)). Percentages of post-settlement mortality at that period ranged from 85 to 88% in back reef areas and from 93 to 95% on reef flats. A strong correlation between density of recruits and per capita mortality suggests density-dependent early postsettlement mortality for E. merra. The limitation of food resources and shelters, perhaps combined with an increase of diseases due to high population densities of settlers, was probably the main cause of mortality just after the mass settlement.

Field observations at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) showed that for a coral reef damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis, juvenile mortality (over 1 year) varied between 20 and almost 100% among sites. Correlative data showed that juvenile mortality increased as a function of initial densities (recruitment), predator densities and the availability of preferred coral substrata. A multiple regression showed that these three variables together did not explain significantly more variation in mortality than the single factor showing the strongest relationship. This appeared to be because recruitment, predator densities and preferred coral substrata were all highly correlated, suggesting that one, two or all of these factors may be influencing juvenile mortality rates. One hypothesis was that density-dependent mortality in juveniles was the result of an interaction between predators (which appear to aggregate at high-recruitment sites) and the availability of preferred substrata (predator refuges). We tested this hypothesis by using both laboratory and field experiments to see whether fish predation could significantly alter survivorship of this damselfish, and whether this impact was dependent upon the coral substratum. The laboratory experiment was designed to test the effects of three common predators (Pseudochromis fuscus, Cephalopholis boenak and Thalassoma lunare) and three different coral substrata that varied in their complexity (Pocillopora damicornis, Acropora nasuta and A-nobilis) on the survival of juvenile Pomacentrus moluccensis. There was a significant interaction between predator species and microhabitat in determining survival, Pseudochromis fuscus and C-boenak were both significantly better at capturing juvenile damselfish than T-lunare. Juvenile survivorship was significantly better when they were given the more complex corals, Pocillopora damicornis and A-nasuta, compared with those given the open-structured species A-nobilis. This pattern reflects habitat selection in the field. Predators differed in their strike rates and the proportion of strikes that were successful, but all exhibited greater success at prey capture where A-nobilis was provided as shelter.

For each species at both spatial scales, per capita mortality rates of new settler cohorts increased monotonically with density, whereas those of the next older cohort were density independent. Intra- and especially intercohort processes induced density-dependent mortality in new settler cohorts. Despite experimental densities that were only 15-25% of ambient, similar to 50% of the spatial variance in settler abundance was reduced by density-dependent mortality in 2 wk. The relative contributions of primary recruitment limitation and subsequent density-dependent loss in setting the average abundance of 2-wk-old recruits were estimated to be similar to 70% and similar to 12%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that density-dependent mortality may only occur for a brief period immediately after settlement of at least some reef fishes and that its influence can be relatively large at comparatively low densities. These results have major implications for current assessments of the relative importance of the processes that drive abundance and dynamics of species with demographically open populations.",106,106,JAN,1999,80,1,35,50,10.2307/176978,26,Schmitt and Holbrook 1999 - Ecology,-17.5,-149.8333333,Ecology,unpaired,80,DD,yes,0,0,-1.00E-04,2.29E-06,0,5.25E-12,Exp,3,Pomacentridae,Dascyllus_trimaculatus,planktivore,2.8,reef,Moorea,Pacific,present,1,11,mmSL,11

To address this issue, I conducted an experiment investigating whether very early post-recruitment mortality of a coral reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum, is dependent on recruitment density. To quantify the extent to which local populations are likely to be controlled primarily by recruitment or by post-settlement density-dependent mortality, I also measured natural mortality rates and recruitment variation at sites around the island of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.

After this period, initial recruit density had no effects on mortality. Natural monthly mortality rates approximating the monthly mortality monitored during the experiment were measured for naturally recruited fish at sites around the island. Mortality was positively correlated with recruitment density.

Mortality rates around the island were extremely variable and density independent at densities below similar to 1 recruit/m(2). Above that level, mortality rates were higher and tended to increase with further increases in recruitment density. Around St. Croix, three out of eight sites consistently received recruitment above this threshold, while five sites never experienced recruitment above that level during the study. Because spatial patterns of recruitment around St. Croix were consistent over time, some local populations may be controlled mainly by recruitment and density-independent mortality at all times, while others may be chronically affected by post-settlement density dependence. This study gives support to the idea that recruitment limitation and density dependence are not mutually exclusive. Rather, local populations must be characterized by the degree of recruitment, the resultant population density, and the subsequent degree of density-dependent regulation.",66,66,MAY,1999,69,2,177,194,10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0177:EPSMIA]2.0.CO;2,25,Caselle 1999,17.75,-64.58333333,Ecological Mono,unpaired,78,DD,yes,-0.01085401,0.00325,-0.001630796,0.000695,1.06E-05,4.83E-07,Obs,,Labridae,Thalassoma_bifasciatum,planktivore (adults),3.49,reef,LesserAntilles,Caribbean,present,2,10,mmSL,10

We developed a cohere-based framework for quantifying the influence of an external supply of colonists and subsequent density-independent and density-dependent mortality on local abundance. Two complementary approaches - based on limitation and elasticity - revealed the nature of interactions and nonlinearities among these processes. Data for an Indo-Pacific reef fish were used to document the settler-survivor relationship and to quantify natural variation in settlement. Limitation by density-dependence was two-fold and 20-fold greater than by supply or density-independent mortality, respectively. Elasticity analyses showed that adult abundance was 40% more sensitive to small proportionate changes in supply than in density-dependence.

I calculated the per capita mortality of kelp perch as a result of the functional response of its predator by subjecting a range of densities of kelp perch to a low, constant number of kelp bass and different amounts of giant kelp (Macrocystis,pyrifera) as habitat structure and a potential prey refuge. The potential for an aggregative response by kelp bass was determined by exposing densities of kelp perch to natural levels of kelp bass in the field. Per capita mortality of kelp perch in the laboratory was inversely density dependent to density independent with increasing habitat structure. By contrast, per capita mortality in the field was strongly density dependent, with evidence for an aggregative response by kelp bass. Furthermore, emigration and other nonpredatory losses of kelp perch from field plots were negligible, indicating that the product of the functional and aggregative responses by kelp bass induced density-dependent mortality in kelp perch. My results indicated that increasing habitat structural complexity at low densities of kelp perch, coupled with a strong aggregative response by kelp bass, was responsible for the observed pattern of density-dependent mortality. In addition, the distribution and relative abundances of kelp perch and kelp bass at larger spatial scales (entire reefs) were consistent with predation as an important process structuring local populations of kelp perch. The contrasting patterns of short-term per capita mortality found here underscore the need to evaluate both the functional and aggregative responses of predators to their prey. Ultimately, the pattern of mortality expressed will be determined by the relative strengths of these behavioral responses and the degree to which habitat structure provides an effective prey refuge.",186,192,JAN,2001,82,1,245,257,NA,32,"Anderson, 2001",33.45,-118.4833333,Ecology,unpaired,101,DD,yes,0,0,-0.0306,0.0063,0,3.97E-05,Exp,5,Embiotocidae,Brachyistius_frenatus,carnivore,3.5,reef,California,Pacific,present,183,55.5,mmSL,55.5

Using correlational methods commonly employed in single-factor studies. I show that local patterns of abundance of juvenile wrasse could be attributed entirely to either (1) patterns of abundance of settlement habitat, or (2) patterns of larval settlement. This result occurred because habitat and presumed larval delivery covaried in space. I manipulated abundance of settlement habitat in a field experiment to uncouple this covariation and found subsequent settlement to be simultaneously influenced by both factors. However. joint effects of habitat and settlement failed to account for patterns of abundance of juvenile wrasse without also considering a third factor-postsettlement losses-which were density-dependent and substantially modified patterns of settlement.

Habitat characteristics including macroalgae structure, canopy height, rugosity (a measure of structure complexity), temperature, and visibility were measured at each site to assess the influence of these factors on recruit abundance. We assumed that immigration and emigration were not responsible for recruit abundance patterns through time due to the sedentary life history of cunner recruits, We observed differences in recruit abundance over the settlement period among reefs which were likely the result of differences in settlement. However recruitment at the end of the post-settlement period was similar across reefs. Recruit mortality rates among reefs differed in the post-settlement period, with the reef that had the highest density also having the highest mortality rate. Post-settlement mortality rates provided evidence for density-dependent mortality, since habitat and abiotic factors failed to explain the difference in mortality among reefs.

In particular, we explore spatiotemporal variation and covariation among (1) densities of newly settled coral reef fish (Thalassoma hardwicke). (2) environmental characteristics, and (3) the strength of density-dependent mortality. Environmental features of patch reefs were spatially and temporally variable and influenced density-dependent survival. Higher-quality sites (i.e., reefs possessing features that yield greater numbers of recruits at any given settlement level) received greater settlement, and this relationship masked the operation of density dependence when variation in quality among sites (or times) was not distinguished (a common approach in many observational studies of density dependence). Our work illustrates how spatiotemporal covariation in settlement density, and site quality can obscure patterns of density dependence at larger scales, contributing to a phenomenon we call cryptic density dependence.

Over three years-roughly two generations-local populations followed regular annual cycles of abundance that stemmed from seasonal patterns of recruitment. Despite considerable natural and experimentally induced variability in the recruitment of new individuals, adult density remained nearly constant. Because multispecies interactions such as predation can be necessary to regulate marine populations, effective management and conservation requires an ecosystem approach that preserves these interactions.",45,47,MAR,2003,84,3,623,628,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0623:TDDAPR]2.0.CO;2,44,Webster 2003,23.7668152,-76.094504,Ecology,unpaired,138,DD,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Obs,,Grammatidae,Gramma_loreto,planktivore,3.31,reef,Bahamas,Caribbean,present,10,17,mmTL,13.6

We added approximately 600 recruit-sized individuals onto coral reef that parallels patterns in naturally settling fish. Strong, positive density-dependent mortality occurred 3 days, 1-2 weeks, and 4 months after release. Since our study species was patchily distributed, we estimated both mean group size and overall density in a transect. Mortality was more strongly related to mean group size than overall density in a transect, indicating that recruit patchiness was important. Cohesive groups may suffer higher mortality than those spread over larger areas, even if overall density of the latter is greater. Aggregative responses of predators may occur in response to larger groups, so may have contributed to positive density-dependent mortality. Increased conspicuousness to predators and congeneric aggression are additional factors that may vary positively with group size. Tagging of recruits showed migration within but not between transects, so persistence was tantamount to survival. Standard otolith back-calculation techniques employed to reconstruct original size of tagged recruits that persisted 4 months after additions indicated that mortality was also size-dependent. Size-dependent mortality was apparent at the site with the highest mortality but not at the site with the lowest mortality, resulting in different mean body sizes of recruits between sites. Size-dependent mortality may influence estimation of growth and lead to onset of size-based maturity in these fish.

For populations with multiple age or size cohorts, interactions between cohorts may be an important source of density dependence. Between-cohort interactions may be especially intense for many marine fish populations because of the potential disparity in competitive ability between small new recruits and relatively large resident conspecifics. Indeed, for marine fishes, density dependence in local populations appears to be widespread, particularly during a crucial time period following settlement of larvae into juvenile and adult habitats. I tested whether the demography of newly settled juveniles of the planktivorous fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) was affected by the density of adult conspecifics. Using spatially isolated local populations on coral reefs in the Bahamas, I experimentally transplanted a cohort of juveniles to local populations with three treatments of adult density: adults absent, average adult density, and high adult density (twice average). By following the fate of the transplanted juveniles, I determined that juvenile mortality increased as a function of adult density. Juveniles did not experience significantly higher rates of aggression or lower growth at higher densities of adults. However, in the presence of adults, juveniles generally fed at the back of aggregations, where feeding rates tend to be lower. Automated time-lapse video revealed that predators were found most frequently toward the back of aggregations. Thus competition with adults for prime feeding positions may increase predation risk for juveniles by forcing them to overlap spatially with predators. Consequently, interactions between juveniles and adults could influence the demography of subsequent generations in ways that promote local population regulation.",53,53,APR,2004,85,4,986,994,10.1890/02-0576,47,Webster 2004,23.7668152,-76.094504,Ecology,unpaired,169,DD,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Exp,,Grammatidae,Gramma_loreto,planktivore,3.31,reef,Bahamas,Caribbean,present,10,17,mmTL,13.6

It is thus unclear whether these findings extrapolate to larger scales relevant to conservation and management. We show that the results of experiments detecting density-dependent mortality of reef fish on small habitat patches scale up to have similar effects on much larger entire reefs that are the size of small marine reserves and approach the scale at which some reef fisheries operate. We suggest that accurate scaling is due to the type of species interaction causing local density dependence and the fact that localized events can be aggregated to describe larger-scale interactions with minimal distortion. Careful extrapolation from small-scale experiments identifying species interactions and their effects should improve our ability to predict the outcomes of alternative management strategies for coral reef fishes and their habitats.,39,40,20-Sep,2005,102,38,13513,13516,10.1073/pnas.0504306102,50,"Steele and Forrester, 2005",23.7668152,-76.094504,PNAS,unpaired,184,DD,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Obs,,Gobiidae,Coryphopterus_glaucofraenum,meiofauna,NA,reef,Bahamas,Caribbean,present,90,25,mmSL,25

Daily settlement and weekly recruitment were censused on coral heads for 1.5 mo at each of 2 reefs separated by 7 km. We also conducted manipulations of resident conspecifics to test for intraspecific effects on patterns of settlement and recruitment. Temporal variation in settlement between the 2 reefs coincided with the new moon, but peak settlement at one reef lagged the other by 7 to 10 d over 2 settlement periods. Such variation may have been caused by longshore current flow delivering patches of larvae to the reefs in sequence or by high current velocities at one reef coinciding with the new moon that may inhibit and delay settlement. Weekly recruitment was marginally higher than but unrelated to cumulative daily settlement, indicating possible recruitment facilition. In subsequent experimental manipulations settlement occurred only where conspecifics were present and was inversely density-dependent. Observed early post-settlement mortality of C. cyanea on continuous fore-reef was density-dependent, which is consistent with patterns of mortality for this species previously reported on patch reefs.

While it is widely recognized that supply of larvae (or recruits) is variable and that variable recruitment may affect the relative contribution of pre- and post-settlement factors, less effort has been made to quantify how variation in the strength of post-settlement mortality (particularly density-dependent mortality) will affect the importance of processes that determine population size. In this study, I examined the effects of habitat complexity on mortality of blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus) within nearshore reefs off central California. I first tested whether variation in habitat complexity (measured as three-dimensional complexity of rocky substrate) affected the magnitude of both density-independent and density-dependent mortality. I then used limitation analysis to quantify how variation in habitat complexity alters the relative influence of recruitment, density-independent mortality, and density-dependent mortality in determining local population size. Increased habitat complexity was associated with a reduction in both den si ty-in dependent and density-dependent mortality. At low levels of habitat complexity, limitation analysis revealed that mortality was strong and recruitment had relatively little influence on population size. However, as habitat complexity increased, recruitment became more important. At the highest levels of habitat complexity, limitation by recruitment was substantial, although density-dependent mortality was ultimately the largest constraint on population size. In high-complexity habitats, population dynamics may strongly reflect variation in recruitment even though fluctuations may be dampened by density-dependent mortality. By affecting both density-in dependent and density-dependent mortality, variation in habitat complexity may result in qualitative changes in the dynamics of populations. These findings suggest that the relative importance of pre- vs. post-settlement factors may be determined by quantifiable habitat features, rather than ambient recruitment level alone. Because the magnitude of recruitment fluctuations can affect species coexistence and the persistence of populations, habitat-driven changes in population dynamics may have important consequences for both community structure and population viability.",64,64,JUL,2007,88,7,1716,1725,10.1890/06-0591.1,79,johnson_2007,36.56,-121.9383333,Ecology,unpaired,268,DD,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Obs,,Sebastidae,Sebastes_mystinus,planktivore,3.48,kelp,California,NA,present,10,90,mmTL,72

I examined the potential for this phenomenon in two fishes, a wrasse and its grouper predator, at a Caribbean island where the near-shore oceanographic regime produces a temporally consistent spatial pattern of fish recruitment. I found that recruitment and adult abundance of groupers were spatially correlated with recruitment of wrasse prey. Furthermore, the local abundance of predators strongly affected the nature of density-dependent prey mortality. At sites with few predators, wrasse mortality was inversely density-dependent, while mortality was positively density-dependent at sites with higher predator densities.

All else being equal, strong density-dependent mortality should select against the formation of high-density aggregations, yet the juveniles of many reef fishes aggregate. In light of this apparent contradiction, we hypothesized that the form and intensity of density dependence vary with the spatial scale of measurement. Individual groups might enjoy safety in numbers, but predators could still produce density-dependent mortality at larger spatial scales. We investigated this possibility using recently settled juvenile bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a small, aggregating reef fish. An initial caging experiment demonstrated that juvenile bluehead wrasse settlers suffer high predation, and spatial settlement patterns indicated that bluehead wrasse juveniles preferentially settle in groups, although they are also found singly. We then monitored the mortality of recently settled juveniles at two spatial scales: microsites, occupied by individual fish or groups of fish and separated by centimeters, and sites, consisting of similar to 2400-m(2) areas of reef and separated by kilometers. At the microsite scale, we measured group size and effective population density independently and found that per capita mortality decreased with group size but was not related to density. At the larger spatial scale, however, per capita mortality increased with settler density.

At the small, within-site scale, both recruitment and adult survivorship of kelp bass were density-dependent and positively related to kelp abundance. At the larger, among-site scale, the spatial pattern of adult kelp bass abundance was predicted well by the pattern of kelp bass larval supply, but there was a consistent negative spatial relationship between kelp abundance and kelp bass larval supply despite the positive effects of kelp on kelp bass at the smaller spatial scale. This large-scale negative relationship was likely a product of a channel-wide spatial mismatch between oceanographic conditions that favor kelp survival and those that concentrate and distribute fish larvae.

Species that live in groups, such as shoaling fish, can experience both direct density-dependent mortality through resource limitation and inverse number-dependent mortality via increased feeding rates and predator evasion in larger groups. To investigate the role of these processes in a temperate reef fish population, we manipulated the density and group size of the shoaling species Trachinops caudimaculatus on artificial patch reefs at two locations with different predator fields in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. We compared mortality over four weeks to estimates of predator abundance and per capita availability of refuge and food to identify mechanisms for density or number dependence. Mortality was strongly directly density dependent throughout the experiment, regardless of the dominant predator group; however, the limiting resource driving this effect changed over time. In the first two weeks when densities were highest, density-dependent mortality was best explained by refuge competition and the abundance of benthic predators. During the second two weeks, food competition best explained the pattern of mortality. We detected no effect of group size at either location, even where pelagic-predator abundance was high. Overall, direct density effects were much stronger than those of group size, suggesting little survival advantage to shoaling on isolated patch reefs where resource competition is high. This study is the first to observe a temporal shift in density-dependent mechanisms in reef fish, and the first to observe food limitation on short temporal scales.

A decline in habitat may lead to crowding of live coral specialists into remnant habitat patches, intensifying intraspecific competition. Increased local densities of conspecifics are known to negatively affect key demographic processes, but the magnitude of density effects and the role of crowding in response to habitat loss are poorly understood. In this study we examined habitat use and relationships between habitat availability and population density in a coral-dwelling damselfish - Chrysiptera parasema. First, we conducted habitat use and availability surveys to establish the level of habitat selectivity. We then investigated the evidence for crowding due to habitat loss by comparing densities within juvenile aggregations on natural reefs with high and low cover of the preferred habitat. Finally, we used a manipulative patch-reef experiment to measure the potential effects of crowding on mortality of juvenile C. parasema. Surveys revealed that 97% of juvenile C. parasema were associated with Acropora corals. Furthermore, C. parasema densities were closely related to the cover of bottlebrush Acropora, the preferred growth form. Contrary to predictions, there was no evidence of crowding on natural reefs with low coral cover, but rather, reefs with abundant Acropora cover supported larger aggregations with double the density of juveniles. We hypothesized that low densities of C. parasema on natural reefs with low coral cover could be explained by intense intraspecific competition. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile mortality was density-dependent, with mortality 20% higher on high-density experimental patch-reefs compared to low-density reefs. Behavioural observations on the patch-reefs revealed that the frequency of agonistic interactions and distance to shelter were both unrelated to conspecific densities, highlighting the need for further research into mechanisms underpinning density dependent mortality. These results suggest that intraspecific competition may play an important role in reducing reef fish abundance as a consequence of habitat loss. Given that coral reef systems are currently under threat, with a global decline in coral cover, this study adds to the growing body of knowledge of how disturbances to habitat may affect reef fish communities.

We aimed to measure the relative importance of seascape attributes at various spatial scales (from seascape to microhabitat) in fish settlement and post-settlement processes. Along the coast of Minorca Island (NW Mediterranean), Diplodus sargus settlement variability was higher among the southern coast compared to the variability in the northern one. Independently of coast location, sheltered nurseries presented lower settlement intensity and recruitment levels compared to exposed ones. Such patterns suggested differential larval supply according to exposure level. Furthermore, subsequent density-dependent post-settlement mortality reduced the cove-specific variability of initial settlement. In addition, inside each cove, juveniles displayed ontogenetic changes of microhabitat use: smaller juveniles were more abundant in the most heterogeneous microhabitat. Consequently, juvenile density distributions responded to seascape attributes at different spatial scales; this suggests that both lager scale attributes and microhabitat influence both settlement and post-settlement processes, and may be limiting for recruitment. Our study demonstrated the importance of a diversified seascape to promote fish population replenishment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
