## Abstract
This dataset contains raw values of initial density, final density, time, and experimental design details extracted from published literature on reef fish populations. These data form the empirical basis for nonlinear mortality model fitting across substudies and are used to estimate α (density-independent mortality) and β (strength of density dependence). The file includes metadata annotations and identifiers for tracking original sources and substudies. It is foundational to our synthesis in "Widesp...

## Notes
- This file represents the rawest form of mortality-density data used in our synthesis.
- Substudies with missing values or noted as "CUMULATIVE" in the Notes column were excluded from model fitting.
- Use substudy_num to link this file to metadata and model outputs in other files.
- For reproducibility and transparency, we retained partial or problematic entries with annotation in the Notes column.
