## Source Publication
[Mendez et al.] (PNAS. 2018). “Title from PNAS 2018” doi:10.1073/pnas.1719358115

## Description
This file contains raw ecological measurements (density, mortality, time, treatment metadata) manually extracted from figures and tables in Mendez et al. (2018). These data were digitized to support modelling of density-dependent mortality in reef fish and included alongside other extracted datasets in our synthesis.

## File Format
- Format: CSV, comma-separated, UTF-8 encoding  
- Contains columns representing subtudy ID, initial/final densities, duration, treatment/group labels, and coding flags.

## Column Descriptions
- `study_id`: Identifier matching source study from PNAS 2018  
- `treatment`: Treatment group or experimental condition [text]  
- `n0`: Initial density (individuals per unit area) [individuals/m²]  
- `nt`: Final density at end of experiment [individuals/m²]  
- `time_days`: Duration of experiment [days]  
- `notes`: Extraction notes or data quality flags [text]  
*(Add additional columns here as appropriate)*

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- **Temporal**: Data collected and published in 2018  
- **Spatial**: Refer to PNAS article for site locations and ecological context

## Usage
- Used in `2_beta_estimate.R` to parameterize nonlinear mortality models  
- Linked to broader dataset via `study_id`  
- Supports synthesis on density-dependent mortality across reef fishes
